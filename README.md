# Lox

Lox is a toy language that is implemented as you work through the book "Crafting Interpreters" by Bob Nystrom ([link](https://craftinginterpreters.com))

Currently this project is only able to scan tokens, generate an AST for simple expressions, and print out the tree.

## Usage

Run `cargo run <lox file>` to interpret a file

Run `cargo run` to launch a REPL
